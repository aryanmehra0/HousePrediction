# House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a simple House Price Prediction model implemented using Python. The project follows a structured process, including data cleaning, model development using Ridge regression, and the creation of a web-based user interface using Flask.

Key Components
## Project Overview:Provide a brief introduction to the project, explaining its purpose and objectives.The dataset used for training and testing the model is taken from kaggle.
## Dataset Description: The dataset used, including the features (e.g., number of bedrooms, square footage, location) and the target variable (house price). Information about the source of the dataset and any preprocessing steps applied (cleaning, feature engineering, etc.).
## Model Architecture: The machine learning model(s) used for house price prediction (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks).

## Data Cleaning: The model utilizes a dataset from Kaggle (Seattle House Price Prediction). The dataset undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, categorical data, and other preprocessing steps.

## Model Development: The machine learning model is implemented using Ridge regression, leveraging the scikit-learn library. The trained model is saved for later use.

## Flask Web Application: The project incorporates a Flask web application, providing a user-friendly interface for predicting house prices. Users can input details such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, and zip code to receive a price prediction.
